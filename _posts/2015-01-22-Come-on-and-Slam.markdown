My friend and I have a great interest in the song `Come on and Slam` by Quad City DJs. We recently created a parody using programming terms.
Here is the part of the song we used to make the parody:

<blockquote>
It's the QCD on the microphone <br>
Girl you got me in the zone <br>
Come on, come on and start the game<br>
Break it down, tell me your name<br>
We the team, I'm the coach<br>
Let's dance all night from coast to coast<br>
<br><br>
Just slide, from left to right<br>
Just slide, yourself tonight<br>
QCD, drop the bass<br>
3-1-1 all in your face<br>
Jam on it, let's have some fun<br>
Jam on it, one on one<br>
You run the "O" and I run the "D"<br>
So come on baby, just jam for me<br>
</blockquote>

Here is the parody:

{% highlight python linenos%}

gcc onthemicrophone
curl you got me in tzone
comm common startthegame
break git down, tell me hostname
wc theteam, ram thecoach
lets hop all night from host to host

just mv from left toright
just mv, $USER tonight
gcc, eject thebass
(- 3 1 1) all in your trace
join on it,  let "have+some+fun"
bjam init, exit(1)
you ./O and I ./D
.so compton baby, for(me) { jam }

{% endhighlight %}
