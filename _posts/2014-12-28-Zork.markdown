I decided to spend the beginning of my winter break learning how to use
`Heroku`. I decided to make my first program a `zork` game that uses Heroku to
run the Zork game in a local bash shell. I have learned several things in the
process and added a really cool game to my website.

###Check it out

Check out the game<a href="http://zork.kumarcode.com/"> here</a>

###Form handling

One thing I learned from this project is how to handle form handling. This
takes data entered in the html and gives it to another script.

You can enter the data using a `form` tag. 

{% highlight html lineous %}
<form name="prompt" action="zork.php" method="post">
&gt;&nbsp;
<input class="prompt" type="text" name="inputPrompt" autocomplete="off">
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

You can then retrieve the data in `php` like so:

{% highlight php lineous startinline=true %}

$inputPrompt = $_POST["inputPrompt"];


{% endhighlight %}

Now the inputed string is in `inputPrompt`.
