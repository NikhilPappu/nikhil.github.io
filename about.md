<p>Here I ramble on about the stuff I like to do.</p>

<h3>Chess</h3>
<p>
I play chess regularly on chess.com and occasionally solve puzzles or learn new
openings. I would recommend the following YouTube channels to anyone who wants
to improve their game: Saint Louis Chess Club, ChessNetwork, PowerPlayChess,
Agadmator's Chess Channel, and iChess.net.


<h3>Guitar</h3>
I picked up guitar about two years ago and have learnt a few songs since then but
haven't been able to get to much theory or ear training.
I recorded myself playing the guitar parts of some tracks a while back. These are
quite off tempo and have terrible production quality. I need to make better ones
sometime. <br>

psychological, dystopia, steampunk and space operas in
the form of tv shows or book series. Here are some of my favorites:

<h3>Games</h3>

I have a fascination for video games, their design and the various elements
that go into them like art, animation, player interaction, challenge, music and writing
among others. I especially fancy retro-themed indie games and strategy games.

<ul>
  <li>Shovel Knight Series</li>
