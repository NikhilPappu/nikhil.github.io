<p>Here's some things that fancy me:</p>

<h3>Chess</h3>
<p>
You can find me playing Blitz Chess on Lichess. 

<h3>Guitar</h3>

A rather off-tempo guitar cover with terrible lighting I made a while back:

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<p>Fantasy is the best genre regardless of medium (books,
comics, movies, animation) and Brandon Sanderson is the GOAT. Fight
me!

<h3>Games</h3>

I'd never be bored of strategy RPGs or retro-themed games. Among my
favorites are Castlevania, Advance Wars, and Shovel Knight.
