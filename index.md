<h1>About</h1>
<p>
I am a 5th year Integrated M. Tech (B.Tech + M.Tech) student of computer
science and engineering at IIIT Bangalore, India, where I am currently working
on my master's thesis under the supervision of <a
href="https://sites.google.com/site/ashishcrypto/">Prof. Ashish Choudhury</a>. I
am interested to work on areas in cryptography and distributed computing.
