<h1>About</h1>
<p>
I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at Portland State
University. I am interested in the areas of cryptography, complexity
theory, quantum computing, and more broadly in theoretical computer
science. Currently, my research focuses on analyzing the security of
classical cryptographic constructions in the presence of quantum
adversaries.

Previously, I was a Computer Science undergraduate at IIIT Bangalore,
where I studied secure multiparty computation and byzantine consensus
during my senior year.  I wrote my thesis titled <i> Perfectly-Secure
Asynchronous Multiparty Computation for General Adversaries</i> under
the supervision of Prof. <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/ashish-choudhury">Ashish Choudhury</a>.
