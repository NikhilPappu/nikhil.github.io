<p> I use Arch Linux with a tiling window manager (awesomeWM) and use vim for 
most programming and editing. I mostly use free, open source and minimalist
software for transperancy, efficiency and extensibility. As a result, I often
prefer terminal programs and programs with vim-based bindings. A large part of 
my inspiration comes from the YouTube channel <a
