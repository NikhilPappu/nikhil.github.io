<p>Here I will write about the fun (and the pain) I have with Arch. Here is my archey image.</p>
<style> text-indent: 0;</style><p>I did not start my linux expereice with Arch. In 11th grade I installled ubuntu <i class="icon-ubuntu"></i>, however at that time I disliked how gnome <i class="icon-gnome"></i> was difficult to customize. In my freshmen year of college I switched to linux mint<i class="icon-linux-mint"></i> with KDE <i class="icon-kde"></i>. However, I did not like how I had to reinstall the whole distro to upgrade. I was ready to switch to Fedora <i class="icon-fedora"></i>.  However a friend convinced me to switch to Arch <i class="icon-arch"></i> with the i3 tilling window manager.</p> 
<p>Here I will write about the fun (and the pain) I have with Arch. Here is my Arch info.</p>
