<p>Here's some things I fancy:</p>

<h3>Chess</h3>
<p>
You can find me playing Blitz Chess on <a href="https://lichess.org/@/nickpappu">
Lichess</a>.

<h3>Guitar</h3>

Here's a somewhat off-tempo guitar cover with terrible lighting I made a while back:

<h3>Games</h3>

<p>
I could never be bored of strategy RPGs or retro-themed games. Among my
favorites are Castlevania, Advance Wars, and Shovel Knight.

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<p>There's nothing that captures my imagination like a fantasy world with its own
history, politics, magic systems etc. In my opinion, no one pulls one
off better than Brandon Sanderson.

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I used to listen to retro progressive rock back in the day.

my favorite instrumental albums:</p>
