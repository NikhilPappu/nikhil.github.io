<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p> I use Arch Linux with a tiling window manager (awesomeWM) and use vim for 
most coding and editing. I mostly use free, open source, and minimalist
software for transparency, efficiency, and extensibility. As a result, I often
prefer terminal programs and programs with vim-based bindings.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<h3>Chess</h3>
<p>
I play chess regularly on chess.com and occasionally solve puzzles or learn new
openings. I would recommend the following YouTube channels to anyone who wants
to improve their game: Saint Louis Chess Club, ChessNetwork, PowerPlayChess,
Agadmator's Chess Channel, and iChess.net.


<h3>Guitar</h3>
I picked up guitar 2 years ago and have learnt a few songs since then, but I
haven't gotten to much theory or ear training. I recorded myself playing
the guitar parts of some tracks a while back. These are quite off tempo and have
terrible production quality. I need to make better ones sometime.

<h3>Games</h3>

I have a fascination for video games and the various elements 
that go into their design, such as art, animation, story, player interaction,
and music among others. I especially fancy retro-themed indie games
and strategy games. Here are some of my favorites: 

<ul>
