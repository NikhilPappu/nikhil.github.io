<p>Here's some things I fancy:</p>

<h3>Chess</h3>
<p>
I play Blitz Chess online on Lichess. Most of my games open with the Queen's Gambit or the Caro-Kann
defence. If memorizing openings isn't your thing, I'd recommend checking out Chess960.
</p>

<h3>Guitar</h3>

My guitar covers can be found <a href="/guitar/">here</a>:

<h3>Games</h3>

<p>
I could never be bored of strategy RPGs or retro-themed games. Among my
favorites are Castlevania, Advance Wars, and Shovel Knight.
</p>

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<p>There's nothing that captures my imagination like a fantasy world with its own
history, politics, magic systems etc. In my opinion, no one pulls one
off better than Brandon Sanderson.
</p>


<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I used to listen to retro progressive rock back in the day.
These days, I mostly listen to instrumental math rock.
A list of some of my favorite instrumental albums can be found here:
